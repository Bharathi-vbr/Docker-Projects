# 🗃️ Docker Volumes

## 🧩 Problem Statement

By default, data created inside a Docker container is **lost** when the container is removed. This poses a problem when we need to **persist data** across container restarts or share data between containers.

---

## ✅ Solution

Docker provides two main mechanisms to persist and manage data outside the container's ephemeral file system:

1. **Volumes**
2. **Bind Mounts** (Mounting a host directory into a container)

---

## 📦 Volumes

Volumes are the **preferred way** to persist data in Docker. They are stored in a part of the host filesystem managed by Docker (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/` by default) and **not tied to the host directory structure**.

They provide several benefits:

- Managed entirely by Docker
- Easily backed up and migrated
- Can be safely shared between containers

### 🔨 Create a Volume

```
docker volume create <volume_name>
```
### 📌 Mount the Volume to a Container
```
docker run -it -v <volume_name>:/data <image_name> /bin/bash
```
This mounts the volume <volume_name> to the /data directory inside the container. Any files written to /data will persist even if the container is deleted.

### 📂 Bind Mounts (Host Directory as Mount)
Bind mounts allow you to mount a specific directory on the host machine directly into a container. This provides more control and transparency but comes with some caveats.

### 📌 Run a Container with a Bind Mount
docker run -it -v <host_path>:<container_path> <image_name> /bin/bash
Example:
```
docker run -it -v /home/user/app-data:/data myapp-image /bin/bash

```
This mounts the host directory /home/user/app-data into the container's /data directory.

⚠️ Changes in the host directory are reflected immediately in the container, and vice versa.

### 🔍 Key Differences: Volumes vs. Bind Mounts
### Feature	Volumes	Bind Mounts
| Feature                     | Volumes                         | Bind Mounts                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Managed by Docker           | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No                        |
| Backed up by Docker         | ✅ Yes                           | ❌ No                        |
| Requires existing directory | ❌ No (Docker creates)           | ✅ Yes (must exist)          |
| Flexibility                 | ✅ High                          | ⚠️ Depends on host setup    |
| Best suited for             | Complex/production environments | Local development/debugging |

### 📝 Conclusion
Use Volumes when you want Docker-managed, persistent data that's portable and easier to backup.

Use Bind Mounts for development or quick testing where you want direct access to the host's filesystem.

Both approaches allow data to persist beyond the lifetime of a single container — choose based on your use case.
